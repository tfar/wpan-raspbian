# wpan-raspbian
Tools for a WPAN enabled Raspbian

## Overview

To ease deployment the folder structure in this repo matches root filesystem
layout of Raspbian - just copy files as need to the respective location. They
depend on a Raspbian Jessie running a WPAN enabled Linux Kernel with installed
WPAN tools.

Take a look at our [Wiki] for a guide to create a WPAN enabled Raspbian image.

_Note_: install or running these scripts and services requires _root_ or _sudo_
privileges!

## Helper scripts

The following shell scripts are little helper to create and delete lowpan or
monitor devices. To install the scripts copy them as follows:

```
# cp <path/to/repo/clone>/usr/local/sbin/* /usr/local/sbin/.
# chmod +x /usr/local/sbin/*
```

### Create lowpan device

Create a 6LoWPAN device named `lowpan0` with distinct `CHANNEL` and `PANID`.
This script will also take down an existing `monitor0` device and will update
the _channel_ and _pan id_ of `lowpan0` if it already exists. This script is
used by the systemd lowpan service described below to create a device on startup.
```
# create_lowpan <CHANNEL> <PANID> [<LLADDR>]
```
_Note1_: optionally this scripts allows to modify/set the LLADDR of the lowpan
device, as some devices generate a new LLADDR at each boot.
_Note2_: this script will also unload the kernel module for UDP header
compression `nhc_udp`, as this is not supported by the RIOT-OS (yet).

### Delete lowpan device

Delete an existing 6LoWPAN device named `lowpan0`. This script is used
by the systemd lowpan service described below to take down the device.
```
# delete_lowpan
```

### Create monitor device

Create a 6LoWPAN monitoring device named `monitor0` with distinct `CHANNEL`.
This script will also take down an existing `lowpan0` device and will update
the _channel_ of an existing `monitor0`.
```
# create_monitor <CHANNEL>
```

### Delete monitor device

Delete an existing 6LoWPAN monitoring device named `monitor0`.
```
# delete_monitor
```

## Systemd service

For _real_ IoT deployment you typically want to have your 6LoWPAN devices
created and configured during the boot process. Raspbian Jessie uses _Systemd_
to run services, so we want to use that to init a lowpan devices on startup.

The `lowpan.service` file provides a service definition to create `lowpan0`. It
requires the file `/etc/default/lowpan` to specify _channel_ (`CHN`), _panid_
(`PAN`), and (optional) the _link layer address_ (`MAC`). Further it uses the
scripts `create_lowpan` and `delete_lowpan` as described above, so install them
as well.

To install the service, copy the files
```
# cp <path/to/repo/clone>/etc/default/lowpan /etc/default/.
# cp <path/to/repo/clone>/etc/systemd/lowpan.service /etc/systemd/system/.
# systemctl enable lowpan.service
```
_Note_: modify _channel_ and _panid_ if required in `/etc/default/lowpan`.

## Router Advertisement Daemon (radvd)

The 6LoWPAN standard states that there must be at least one router (6LR) in a
network answering router solicitations (RS) by responding with router
advertisements (RA). Typically, a rather _strong_ machine like the Pi would also
act as the _Authoritative Border Router_  and gateway (6LBR) between LoWPAN and
_real_ IPv6 networks such as the Internet. A simple way to transform the Pi
in a 6LBR is to run `radvd`. See our [wiki](https://github.com/RIOT-Makers/wpan-raspbian/wiki/Setup-native-6LoWPAN-router-using-Raspbian)
for detailed information.
